# Change Log
## [Unreleased]
### Added
- This ChangeLog.md file
- Snyk, Bithound, Travis CI
- Cross platform improvements (path mappings)
- Session fixup between Express and Socket.io
- env variable `DEBUG=ssh2` will put the `ssh2` module into debug mode
- env variable `debug=WebSSH2` will output additional debug messages for functions
and events in the application (not including the ssh2 module debug)

### Changed
- erorr handling in public/client.js

### Fixed
- Multiple errors may ovewrite status bar which would cause confusion as to what originally caused the error. Example, ssh server disconnects which prompts a cascade of events (conn.on('end'), socket.on('disconnect'), conn.on('close')) and the original reason (conn.on('end')) would be lost and the user would erroneously receive a WEBSOCKET error as the last event to fire would be the websocket connection closing from the app.
- ensure ssh session is closed when a browser disconnects from the websocket
